# Tinder for Lamps

link: https://lamps.educastrillon.xyz/

This right now stands as a proof of concept for a bigger project. In the projects section you can see the ideas I want to implement.<br><br>

"Tinder for Lamps" is a decision outsourcing application. The idea is to be able to bundle together the options you need to decide between, and send them to other people to get their opinion and help you decide. For example, grab a bunch of pictures of lamps, upload them and send it to your partner and see what they think in one quick look.
